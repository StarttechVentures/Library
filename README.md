# The Starttech Ventures Library

## About
This GitHub repository acts as a simple managment system of the growing Starttech Ventures Library.


## How it works

 Books in the library are represented by [Issues](https://github.com/StarttechVentures/Library/issues). Each Issue represent a book in the STV Library. 
  Open Issues are books that are available and Closed Issues are books that have been 'checked out'
